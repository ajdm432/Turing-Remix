# Turing-Remix
Messes up WAV files with randomly generated Turing Machine Tables.
Go into the main method and replace the fileIn with a short WAV file on your computer. 
Then go down to fileOut to give the path for where you would like to write your newly messed up file to.
You can also change the number of states generated for the turing machine in the main method.
